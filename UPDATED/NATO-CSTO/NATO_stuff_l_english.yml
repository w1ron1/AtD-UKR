 NATO_global_logistics_network_desc:0 "The combined navy of NATO is the largest the world has ever seen, patrolling every corner of the globe and securing shipping routes for trade. In times of war, it is to be used to secure the transport of troops and supplies. Pair this with hundreds of transport planes, thousands of fighter and multi-role planes and tens of thousands of trucks, and NATO logistics are a true feat of military and civilian engineering."

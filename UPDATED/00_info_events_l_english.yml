 generic_information.1.t:0 "Information of the Economy system of ATD"
 generic_information.1.d:0 "The economy of Across the Dniper is designed to be simple and hands-off, as opposed to some other modern-day hoi4 mods *cough*cough*TNO*cough*cough*Millenium Dawn*cough*.\n\nTo open the economy tab, click on the money icon on the topbar. At the top of the economy panel, you have expenditure for §YMilitary§!, §YIntelligence§!, §YEducation§! and §YPublic Services§!. These can range from §RMinimal§! to §GExtreme§!, and can only be modified through focus, decision or event. The effects of your expenditure can been seen by hovering over the buttons to the left of the text.\n\nGoing down from there, you will see §YGDP from states§!, which measures the economic activity in your country, and §YBonus GDP§!, from off-map states or alternative sources of income, which are combined to give §YTotal country GDP§!."

 generic_information.1.b:0 "Thank you!"

 generic_information.1001.t:0 "Information of the Economy system of ATD (2)"
 generic_information.1001.d:0 "Now we get to the fun stuff. At the bottom, there is §YCountry GDP per capita§!, §YCountry GDP per capita growth§!, §YInflation§! and §YReal GDP per capita§!.\n\n§YCountry GDP per capita§! and §YCountry GDP per capita growth§! are both taken from your controlled states, and you can see the economic statistics for each state by going onto the GDP map mode. These statistics are then multiplied by state population and merged to give to national stats.\n\n§YInflation§! is set by country, and is taken away from your country's §YGDP per capita growth§! to give §YReal GDP per capita growth§!, which is the measure of how much, and how quickly, the quality of life for your citizens is improving. For §YReal GDP per capita growth§! and §YReal GDP per capita§!, you will want to make these as high as possible, as for §YInflation§!, you'll want to keep it between 1.0% and 7.5%.\n\n§YInflation§! can only be increased or decreased once every 120 days. And yes, I did actually make it so that you cannot decrease inflation if Erdogan is leader. Is it possible to get him as leader? No. Why did I do it? I don't really know."
 generic_information.1001.a:0 "What's up with the state effective GDP thing?"
 generic_information.1001.b:0 "How can I increase state GDP growth?"
 generic_information.1001.c:0 "Thank you!"

 generic_information.1002.t:0 "Information of the Economy system of ATD (3)"
 generic_information.1002.d:0 "If you click on the button on the top-right hand corner of the economy panel, you will see a list of your controlled states, their §YState GDP§!, as well as their §YEffective GDP§!. §YEffective GDP§! is how much of the §YState GDP§! is added to your country's total §YGDP§!. The percentages / multipliers are based on factors such as whether the states is owned, fully controlled, cored, etc."
 generic_information.1002.a:0 "Thank you!"

 generic_information.1003.t:0 "Information of the Economy system of ATD (4)"
 generic_information.1003.d:0 "§YState GDP per capita growth§! can be increased one of two ways:\n\n1) Via focus, decision, or event.\n\n2) By constructing new buildings in a state. This gets updated every month, and different buildings have different impacts on growth.\n\nAlso, state §YState GDP per capita growth§! will always tend to 0% over time, but very slowly, where it the rate of approach to 0% gets smaller the smaller the value. It also takes twice as long to tend to 0% should the value be negative"
 generic_information.1003.a:0 "Thank you!"

 generic_information.2.t:0 "Information of the Combat system of ATD"
 generic_information.2.d:0 "§YTerrain.§!\nThe combat system in ATD works similarly to vanilla, however most major cities have been expanded to be multi province wide, thus leading to more urban terrain. There are some new terrain types, mianly Dense-Urban and Sub-Urban. Dense-Urban is the hardest of the three types to fight in, easiest to defend,  while Sub-Urban is the oposite. \n\n §YCombat width§! is mostly vanilla. \n\n§YMisc.§!\nDivision designs are cheaper, XP is less limited. Most of the other combat related things are Vanilla. There are no AT units, as regular infantry has AT of their own (irregular infantry has less, but they have more defence in cities), which needs to be produced. AA is also like that, but you can also opt into having dedicated AA units in your divisions.\n\nRecon Companies have been reworked into Drone Companies, which work mostly the same as their base-game counterparts with some buffs. The key difference is regular Drone Companies are worse than Mobile Drone Companies in most terrains (especially Forests, Plains and Hills), though are superior than Mobile Drone Companies in Urban environments."

 generic_information.3.t:0 "Information of the Technology system of ATD"
 generic_information.3.d:0 "Technology in Across the Dnieper is somewhat §Ysimilar to vanilla§!. We want to keep the mod vanilla-like for the time being. You may have already found that some technology has been rebalanced in a way. §YThere is less over all factory / dockyard output, most of the technologies start out weaker, but scale with time§!. The mod starts in 2014, which is a long ways away from the main part of the content - Russo-Ukrainian war. This change in technologies should help the player reach that part of the game in a more enjoyable sense, being §Yweaker early on, getting better with time§!. §YWestern countries§! get some §Yresearch bonuses from their laws§!, you can see them yourself. That about wraps up the technology part. Its mostly vanilla, with some balance changes. Oh, and §Ynukes§! are a hidden technology, only unlockable through focuses / events / decisions, like most other things in the mod."
 generic_information.3.a:0 "Thank you!"

 generic_information.4.t:0 "Information of the Equipment Designers of ATD"
 generic_information.4.d:0 "If you have the No Step Back DLC you will get access to the tank designer. It is mostly vanilla, with extra modules to use more modern ideas of tank design (ERA, ATGM's, etc.). \n\nIf you have the By Blood Alone DLC you will get access to the plane designer of the mod. It is also somewhat vanilla, as the mod tries to be more vanilla like for the time being. There are more modules, mainly missile modules, which are used instead of guns, because that's sort of what the IRL meta is xd."
 generic_information.4.a:0 "Thank you!"

 generic_information.5.t:0 "Information on Belarus in ATD"
 generic_information.5.d:0 "Belarus is meant to be a beginer friendly nation in ATD. While Ukraine offers relatively complex mechanics and systems, and Russia is complicated due to its size, Belarus is the oposite. Being a relatively small and a somewhat important nation, its a great choice for a begginer. Belarus starts in an alliance with Russia, however Russia will not call you into any conflicts of their own. You have a reasonable industry, struggling economy and the countries stability is low. As the player of Belarus you have many choices of what you can do, more on that in the next event, if you chose to look at it."
 generic_information.5.a:0 "Take me to the choices!"
 generic_information.5.b:0 "Thank you!"

 generic_information.5001.t:0 "Information of what Belarus can do in ATD"
 generic_information.5001.d:0 "For now there are two main things you can do as Belarus: Keep Lukashenko in charge, or go down the revolution. Keeping Lukashenko doesn't mean you have to stay a loyal russian puppet state. The player is allwed to make a choice to steer away from Russia, and become a more neutral state in eastern europe. \n\n The alterative - Revolution. The player will be faced with a civil war, where they can chose who will lead their nation to victory or defeat. The options include §tSocialists§!, interested in restoring the Soviet union, §YLiberals§!, interested in providing freedom, §2Conservatives§!, interested in keeping the nation strong and stable, and the §ONationalists§!, they seek to secure the belarusian influence in their region by any means necessery. They even have a nuclear program!"

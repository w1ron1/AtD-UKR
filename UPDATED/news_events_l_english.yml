 atd_news.57.desc:0 "After the Donbass war of 2014-15, the situation in eastern Ukraine has been relatively stable, until now. Putin called an emergency session of the security council on the recognition of the Donbass People's Republics, and despite notable hesitation from Sergey Naryshkin, all fell in line. Many observers note that this is similar to the murdering of Caesar, whereby all involved are guilty should the worst come to fruition. The troops are in place, the polititians are ready, all that needs to start the invasion is the order from Putin himself."

 atd_news.58.desc:0 "Shocking news from Russia. The Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, staged an armed uprising today in Rostov-on-Don. The head of Wagner Group Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a statement, "Those who destroyed our youths and took the lives of tens of thousands of Russian soldiers will be punished".\n\nWagner Group was responsible for the core forces of the Russian army in the Russo-Ukraine War from the time of the Russian occupation of Crimea. More recently, however, the group appears to be deeply dissastisfied with ongoing supply problems and the Russian government's attempt to incorporate them into the regular army. In particular, the sluggish war situation seems to have provided a decisive cause for the rebellion."

President [SOV.GetLeader] said after the rebellion began that their answer would be harsh, but within hours, dramatic negotiations between Prigozhin and the government appear to have taken place. Negotiations appear to have been made by Belarusian President [BLR.GetLeader].\n\nPrigozhin is now preparing for the dissolution of Wagner Group and exile in Belarus. Putin said he would not punish Prigozhin, but rumors are already circulating that he went missing in Rostov before he even left exile."

 atd_news.65.desc:0 "Russia has officially cut oil exports to European Union countries. This move is expected to have a devastating impact on the European economy, as Russia is a major supplier of oil to the region. The European Union has been heavily reliant on Russian oil imports, with Russia accounting for approximately 40% of the EU's oil consumption. This reliance has made the EU vulnerable to Russian price hikes and supply disruptions.\n\nRussia's decision to cut oil exports to the EU is a retaliatory measure for the Western sanctions imposed on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions have had a significant impact on the Russian economy, and Russia is seeking to inflict pain on the EU in return. The EU has been scrambling to find alternative sources of oil, but this has proven to be difficult. The United States has pledged to help the EU reduce its dependence on Russian oil, but it is not clear how quickly this can be achieved."

Several western countries, such as Lithuania and the UK have welcomed this news, however most remain cautious about Polish involvement, and have remained largely neutral on the issue.\n\nThe Russian representative at the United Nations, Vitaly Ivanovich Churkin, lashed out at his Polish counterpart, Bogusław Winid, claiming that the Polish 'peacekeeping mission represented no such thing, instead it is clear that the Poles are taking direct orders from Washington to further their reach in Europe.'\n\nBogusław Winid responded to this claim, 'We are helping our neighbour fight terrorists who show no regards for human life.

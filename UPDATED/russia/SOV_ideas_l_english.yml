Tanks fired upon the Moscow white house, as Yeltsin accused the parliamentary deputies of disloyalty to the Russian Federation, as well as being 'too Soviet'. By the end of 1993, Yeltsin had managed to established all but dictatorial control over Russia, all centralised within the office of the Presidency.\n\nNowadays, the most prominent legacy of Black October is the total lack of power in the Duma, as the prime minister and the deputies' jobs are dependant on the President's good graces.

The first humiliated the Russian army on the international stage, showing to the world the sheer state of disarray it was in. The second saw the crushing of Chechen independence, and the establishment of a pro-Kremlin puppet regime in Chechnya.\n\nHowever, it is the brutality and scale of the war that has left it fresh in the Russian mind. About 150 to 250 thousand Chechens fled their homeland or were killed, in a country of only a million people. In response to this brutality, Chechen Islamists responded with a series of sporadic terrorist attacks on Russian territory, most infamously the Dubrovka Theatre hostage crisis, which lead to 171 deaths, and the Beslan school seige, which lead to 333 deaths, including 186 school children. Although the large death tolls were due to the sheer recklessness of the Russian special forces involved, Putin's government has since spun the incidents to fearmonger over Islamist seperatism and strip the Russian people of more of their rights in the name of counter-terrorism."

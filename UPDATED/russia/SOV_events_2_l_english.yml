 russia.1005.t:0 "Happenings In Kiev"
 russia.1005.desc:0 "Amidst the winter Olympics, president Putin met with top advisors to discuss the situation in Kiev. Put simply, it was not going well.\n\nPutin had spent years getting pro Kremlin politicians into key positions in Ukraine, including the presidency, and it seemed to be all for nothing. Anti-Yanukovych protestors appeared to be getting the upper hand, so much so that the FSB believes Yanukovych to already be planning an escape route. As such, Putin ordered that contingency plans be made for a potential intervention by the FSB, in order to secure Russian interests in the region should the worst come to fruition."
 russia.1005.a:0 "You can never be too prepared"

 russia.1006.t:0 "Little Green Men"

 russia.1007.t:0 "The Fate Of Remaining Ukrainian Soldiers"
 russia.1007.desc:0 "After our rapid takeover of Crimea, many Ukrainian troops still remain stranded in the peninsula. President [SOV.GetLeader] has been presented with two options: The first is to let them go back to Ukraine, which would paint us in a good light and give off the impression that we mean their nation no harm. The second is to treat them as we would treat enemy soldiers, and demand they either surrender to us or else."

 russia.1008.desc:0 "In a result that surprised nobody, the people of Crimea have made their voices heard - and they demand to join Russia. The votes have been counted, and over 90% of the local population wants to leave the sinking ship that is Ukraine in favour of their historical homeland.\n\nCelebrations and rallies have been held all over Russia, and the words on peoples lips are..."

 russia.1009.t:0 "Meeting With Iran"
 russia.1009.desc:0 "President Putin meet with Iranian officials earlier to discuss increasing co-operation with the regime in Tehran. On the surface, this was a diplomatic mission to improve ties between the two now sanctioned regimes, under the table the largest area of concern was for Russia to learn from Iran's economy.\n\nSince 1979, Iran has been a pariah to the west, and as such have become experts in getting around sanctions. Iran has agreed to let us in on their secrets, in exchange for increased trade, mostly of military gear to help put down any potential revolts or protests in their country.\n\nThe question is, what is the main field we want help in?"
 russia.1009.a:0 "We want help with our arms industry"
 russia.1009.b:0 "Civilian industries are the most important"

 russia.1010.t:0 "Revolt Against The West"
 russia.1010.desc:0 "As part of our government's ban on western food products as part of their so-called 'counter-sanctions' package, Russian state media has aired segments showing the destruction of western food products, whether it be via demolition, stamping or burning. More restrictions on what food can be imported into Russia from western countries are being discussed in the Duma, as the media celebrates these 'heroes' actions against the collective west."

 russia.1011.desc:0 "Every year, the president of the Russian Federation gives a speech, detailing the state of our nation. This year, however, is special.\n\nWe have welcomed new territories into our nation and are helping our brothers in Donbass resist their western government, but the year has not been all sunshine and rainbows. The west has launched co-ordinated attacks against us, and our economy has suffered greatly because of it.\n\nPresident Putin's speech is expected to be an important one, and as such, he focuses his attention towards..."

 russia.1012.desc:0 "Tragedy strikes the nation, as at 23:31 [?global.date.GetDateStringNoHourLong], Russian opposition figure Boris Nemtsov was assassinated.\n\nAfter continuing to speak out against our operations in Ukraine, Boris Nemtsov had become convinced in his final days that Putin was out to kill him. He unfortunately may have been proven right, as he was shot seven or eight times while walking on Bolshoy Moskoretsky Bridge in Moscow. While our government has denied any involvement in the assassination, many of Nemtsov's colleagues and western analysts are suspicious of our claim, due to suspicious circumstances surrounding his death."

 russia.1013.desc:0 "Sergey Viktorovich Chemezov is a powerful oligarch within Russia, due to his status as CEO of Rostec. This gives him immense influence over our military industry, and makes him a possible king-maker for many factions within Russia.\n\nVladimir Putin has set up a meeting between the two men, in hopes of swaying Chemezov to his side - the question is, what does Putin offer him?"
 russia.1013.a:0 "Offer him some lucrative arms contracts"

 russia.1014.t:0 "Leaders Of Russia"
 russia.1014.desc:0 "Today marks a historic day for the Federation. The institute 'Leaders of Russia' has been given large sums of government funding, with more to come. This is noteworthy as it marks a shift away from the traditional power politics of Russia, instead seeking to take promising bureaucrats and teach them in the art of governance.\n\nUnsurprisingly, much of the political establishment are opposed to the institute, as they see it as a direct challenge to their power."

 russia.1015.desc:0 "After the attack on us from the collective west, many of Russia's young foolishly believed them to be in the right, and believing us to be the aggressor. To counter this, Putin and the Duma have signed into law a new curriculum, with special patriotic classes each week, called 'conversations about the important'. In these classes, we will teach the youth about what the motherland should mean to them, as well as give them the correct worldview on international affairs."
 russia.1015.a:0 "Papya knows best"

 russia.1016.t:0 "Philosophy Class"
 russia.1016.desc:0 "As part of the patriotic classes, our nation's best and brightest have been given the correct worldview on many current affairs, but there still remains some doubts in the mind of our youth. As such, schools are now to teach philosophy as part of these lessons, taking from the works of Solovyov, Gumilyov, and above all, Ilyin. These philosophers have been chosen as they teach our students about the greatness of Russia and her culture, as well as the need to expand Russia's borders for the good of us all.\n\nStudents are expected to go home and study these philosophers, and report their findings back to their teachers."
 russia.1016.a:0 "May we all be in service to our motherland"

 russia.1017.t:0 "Anti-War Protests"
 russia.1017.desc:0 "In response to our intervention in Crimea, many liberal Russians have taken to the street in protest. So far, their movement is contained to the streets of Moscow, but there are no signs of the protests slowing down."
 russia.1017.a:0 "Ok"

 russia.1018.t:0 "The March Of Peace"
 russia.1018.desc:0 "Today, anti-war politicians and organisers held their largest protest so far - the so-called 'march of peace'. In attendance were some of the most vocal of Russia's opposition, notably Boris Nemtsov and Alexei Navalny, as well as some estimated 20,000 other protestors.\n\nMembers of the Duma have gone on fiery rampages against these 'traitors to the motherland', and tensions within Russia only seem to be growing."
 russia.1018.a:0 "Hopefully this will be over soon"

 russia.1019.t:0 "Protests Escalate"
 russia.1019.desc:0 "Emboldened by our government's failures in Crimea, the protests have swelled to never before seen heights. Over a hundred thousand people have demonstrated against our government's actions in Moscow, and thousands more have held smaller protests in the countryside.\n\nThe situation is deteriorating rapidly, and only extreme measures can help us now."
 russia.1019.a:0 "Send in the police to disperse the crowd"
 russia.1019.b:0 "Putin personally addresses the crowd to explain"

 russia.1020.t:0 "Protests Disperse"
 russia.1020.desc:0 "After violent clashes in Moscow, the protests against our intervention in Crimea seem to have ended. Many of the top protestors are currently in custody, and thus they are unable to organise a counter-action against our forces."

 russia.1021.t:0 "Vladimir Putin Assassinated!"
 russia.1021.desc:0 "Unable to get his opinions across to the crowds in an orderly manner, Putin eventually called upon the police to disperse the crowds. However, this ended up being his greatest, and final, mistake. While trying to leave the stadium, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was shot three times by an anti-war protestor. After being rushed to the hospital, he was pronounced dead at [?global.date.GetDateString].\n\nIn his place, the Security Council of the Russian Federation has taken over official control of the country, as the world watches to see what comes next."

 russia.1023.desc:0 "Nicknamed the 'Kinder Surprise' back in the nineties, former prime minister Sergey Kiriyenko has been winning over Putin's ear. As well as this, many institutes linked to him have been producing more and more regional administrators, growing his connections to all factions of the Russian elite.\n\nHowever, Kiriyenko's meteoric growth in recent years has not gone unnoticed. Several people in Putin's inner circle are demanding that he puts Kiriyenko in his place, and view him as a direct threat to their power."

 russia.1024.desc:0 "Over the past several weeks, defence minister Sergei Shoigu has been investigated by Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, where they have linked his daughter's name to an 18 million dollar mansion in the outskirts of Moscow. This has caused many to speculate that Putin want him gone, as Shoigu's predecessor Anatoly Serdyukov was dismissed and investigated over a similar corruption scandal in 2012."

 russia.1025.desc:0 "Since the Union State Treaty on the 8th of December 1999, ties have grown between ourselves and Russia. However, many in Moscow are growing dissatisfied with our supposed feet dragging at the negotiations. This narrative fools nobody. It is clear that Russia seeks to annex us outright, or at the very least force us to be entirely dependent on their good graces."

Thousands of fans have flocked from all over the world to see their teams play, and the Russian economy is booming because of it.\n\nIn the first game of the tournament, Russia thrashed Saudi Arabia 5-0, and Russia has been overcome with a sense of patriotism and joy."
 russia.1029.a:0 "May the best team win!"

 russia.1030.t:0 "Raise The Retirement Age?"
 russia.1030.desc:0 "With support for Putin at an all-time high, and the nation's attention focused on the world cup, it has been suggested in the Duma that the retirement age substantially - from 60 to 65 for men, and 55 to 63 for women. This would be controversial for a multitude of reasons, such as Putin's repeated promises not to raise the retirement age during his term, the substantial increase all at once, and most importantly - the fact that many poor Russians will die before they reach this new retirement age.\n\nHowever, it is known to all that not implementing the reforms will only lead to more economic woes at a time when the economy is far from stable, and will likely lead to a large economic collapse not too long in the future. Furthermore, we would avoid any immediate protests, as public demonstrations are currently banned in Russia due to the ongoing world cup.\n\nLike most decisions in Russia, the choice comes down to Putin."
 russia.1030.a:0 "Implement the reforms."
 russia.1030.b:0 "It is a problem for tomorrow’s leaders, not us"

 russia.1031.t:0 "Protests In Hyde Park"
 russia.1031.desc:0 "In response to our unpopular pension reforms, thousands of ordinary Russians have come out in protest. However, it is too late for many of them. Due to not being able to protest in the immediate aftermath of the announcement due to the ban on protests during the world cup, the protests are less severe than expected, although still not insignificant.\n\nDue to the pension reforms, as well as the perception of misusing the world cup to prevent protests, the approval rating of all members of government, including [SOV_current_leader_surname], has plummeted."

 russia.1032.t:0 "Patriot PMC Formed"
 russia.1032.desc:0 "Over the past decades, global wars have been dominated by the need for plausible deniability, and as such the world has seen an exponential rise in PMC activity. The Americans have Blackwater, the Brits have Aegis, the Germans have Asgaard, and we have Wagner. In order to capitalise on this growth, Sergey Shoigu has been involved in the founding of 'Patriot PMC', an they have already received contracts in Syria due to Shoigu's top position within the military."

 russia.1034.desc:0 "In a surprise to no-one, our government's heavy-handed measures in dealing with protests and opposition has lead to a sharp decline in organised resistance to our regime. An unfortunate result of this, at least for ordinary Russians, is that it is increasingly harder to combat the oligarchs, leaving said oligarchs with more power than ever before under Putin's regime."

 russia.1040.desc:0 "With victory imminent, the question of how to administer Ukraine has come up. In the halls of the Kremlin there are two main factions.\n\nOne side argues that it should be directly incorporated into Russia, as doing so would help eliminate the notions of Ukraine being a separate state from Russia, as well as appease nationalist factions within our government. Doing this would likely help in administrating it, as it would allow our internal security forces to have greater control over the territory than they would if it were a seperate country, although it would make us even more unpopular with the west.\n\nThe other faction suggests installing a puppet regime in Kiev, arguing that it would give legitimacy to our claims of 'respecting our brother nation', as well as reduce overall opposition."

This was to maintain secrecy about our true intentions, but this approach has backfired horrendously.\n\nWhile stationed in Belarus, many of our troops sold off vital equipment and supplies, and were given only a day or two's notice about the invasion, too little to undo the damage.

In the essay, Putin claims that the fates of Russians and Ukrainians are interlocked, as we are but one people. Putin also brings into question Ukraine's sovereignty, and 'right to exist as a nation', as he sees Ukraine as and artificial creation of the Bolsheviks. He also claims that the government of Ukraine is one of globalist Banderites, who oppress the ethnic Russians in the east as part of a 'western anti-Russia project'. As such, he ends the essay with highlighting how it is not only a right, but a necessity for Russia to interfere, and perhaps intervene directly in Ukrainian affairs, and to take what is rightfully ours."

Half of Russia's already middling GDP is stored outside of the country, and what remains inside is concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy and powerful men. About a fifth of all Russians live under the poverty line, and many of the rural areas are without proper water, sewage and heating systems.

 russia_propaganda.17.desc:0 "A new documetary has been released today titled 'Miroporyadok 2018', translating into English as 'World Order 2018'. The documentary is filmed by Rossiya-One television hosts Saida Medvedeva and Vladimir Solovyov, interviewing President Putin to seek his insights into his assessment of internal and external affairs. Putin started by claiming that Russia's actions in Crimea were a direct and necessary response to the growing anti-Russia bloc, and put Russia on the world stage once more as a great power .President Putin also railed against those who, in his eyes, were trying to expand this anti-Russia bloc, warning their actions would hurt themselves, not Russia - "Those who drop poison somewhere will swallow it themselves in the end, they themselves will be poisoned by this poison."\n\nThe documentary has further propelled Solovyov's career and de-facto title of 'Putin's favourite journalist' (or as his critics call him, 'Putin's Goebbels') following a long career of journalism and long working relation ship with Vladimir Putin, for which Putin himself awarded Solovyov with the Russian 'Order of Honour' medal in 2013."

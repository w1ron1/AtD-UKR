 victor_yanukovych_leader_desc:0 "Born in 1950 in Yenakijeve, a city in Donetsk oblast, Victor Yanukovych has always had a positive view of Russia and the Russian people, and has found his way into power in numerous positions, thanks in part to help from the Kremlin.\n\nHowever, he is far from popular with the more pro-west Ukrainians of the country. It took the orange revolution for him to get ousted from power in 2006 after allegations of election fraud, and his banning and trials of opposition leaders during his premiership between 2010-2014 has only reaffirmed notions of his corruption and loyalty to Moscow in the minds of ordinary Ukrainians.\n\nSince his dismissal of pro-EU legislation in late 2013 in favor of pro-Russian ones, there have been demonstrations and riots in Kyiv over his rule. He stands on shaky soil, and it might just take one kick for the whole rotten structure to come crashing down."

 petro_poroshenko_leader_desc:0 "Armiia, mova, vira - Army, language, faith.\n\nThose are the three words that have summed up Poroshenko's presidency, as he represents the new, post-Maidan Ukraine. Born in 1965, he spent most of his childhood in what is now Tansnistria, where his father was a successful businessman, with several factories under his ownership. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he went on to acquire much of the industry in south-west Ukraine, and by 2012,  was estimated to be worth over one billion dollars.\n\nPoroshenko now represents a westernizing Ukraine, with programs to westernize the army, industry, and Ukrainian society at large. However, his open corruption and oligarchism brings into question just how far the revolution succeeded?"

 volodymyr_zelenskyy_leader_desc:0 "A comedian from Kryvyi Rih, nobody could have ever thought that such a man would become the figurehead for Ukrainian democracy and national revitalization, but here we are.\n\nA comedian from the start, Zelenskyy only got political after the events of 2014, creating a TV show 'Servant of the People' starring himself as president of Ukraine. Ahead of the 2019 elections, he created the political party of the same name, and appealed to voters' on a platform of anti-corruption, privatization, as well as continuing the de-Communisation of his predecessor and balancing relations between the EU and Russia. The rest as they say, is history..."

 yulia_tymoshenko_leader_desc:0 "Two-time prime minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko has succeeded in becoming the first female President of Ukraine.\n\nBorn in Dnipro in 1960, she grew up in a predominantly Russian-speaking community, and became interested in Ukrainian politics and society after the collapse of the Soviet Union, often being in positions of power throughout the past two decades, promoting Ukrainian ascension into the EU and NATO, as well as a transition from a mixed economy to a fully free-market one.\n\nHowever, her story is not one of 'overcoming the glass ceiling' and social justice as some western liberals may believe. She is one of the richest and most powerful people in Ukraine, and although her imprisonment for embezzlement and abuse of power was undoubtedly a political one by Yanukvoych, her shady backroom deals and rumours of bribery do cause some doubt in her sincerity amongst the Ukrainian population."
